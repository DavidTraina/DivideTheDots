You can run a slightly altered version of this project online at: https://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/648372
This online version does not run as well and the visuals are slightly buggy because it is ported to JavaScript.

To export this Processing Sketch as an Android app, keep DivideTheDots.pde, Dot.pde, AnimatedSection.pde and the data folder inside the DivideTheDots folder. Open DivideTheDots.pde with Processing 3.XX, which can be downloaded at https://processing.org/download/. Click on the modes tab in the top right and select the Android mode (you may have to install it). Connect a compatible Android device to your machine and select "Run on Device". Processing will build and android project and install the .apk on your device.
