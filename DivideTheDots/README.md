You can run a slightly altered version of this project online at: https://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/648372
This online version does not run as well and the visuals are slightly buggy because it is ported to JavaScript.

To run the project as intended, keep DivideTheDots.pde, Dot.pde, AnimatedSection.pde and the data folder inside the DivideTheDots folder. Run DivideTheDots.pde with Processing 3.XX, which can be downloaded at https://processing.org/download/

Place an image in the data folder and change the setupPhoto() call in the setup() method to change the picture that is reveled.
