You can run a slightly altered version of this project online at: https://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/648372
This online version does not run as well and the visuals are slightly buggy because it is ported to JavaScript. This version also gets ported to JavaScript, so it may exhibit similar issues. 

Simply download the DivideTheDots-processing_dot_js folder and open DivideTheDots.html in a browser. The sketch should appear on the page.

If the page appears blank, this is likely because your browser is suppressing code running from local files. You will either need to tell the browser to allow code from local files or host it on a server.
