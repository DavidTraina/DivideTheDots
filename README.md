Run with Processing 3.XX

Place an image in the data folder and change the setupPhoto() call in the setup() method to change the picture that is reveled. 

You can run a slightly altered version of this project online at: https://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/648372
This online version does not run as well and the visuals are slightly buggy because it is ported to JavaScript.
